## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Which form plugins are supported?

The plugin currently supports Gravity Forms and Contact Form 7. You can also enable it for all WordPress emails, but this should be used with caution as it will affect system emails as well.

### Can I customize the signature message?

Yes! You can fully customize your signature text from the Settings page. You can use placeholders like `{site_name}` and `{site_url}` in your signature. You can also control whether to include your website URL and the date/time when the email was sent.

### Can I position the signature at the top of the email instead of the bottom?

Yes, you can choose whether the signature appears at the top or bottom of emails from the Settings page.

### Does this work with HTML emails?

Yes, the plugin automatically detects whether an email is HTML or plain text and formats the signature accordingly. For HTML emails, you can even add custom CSS to style your signature.

### Will this affect my password reset and other system emails?

By default, no. The WP Mail integration is disabled by default, and even when enabled, the plugin tries to exclude common system emails like password resets and user notifications. However, if you enable the WordPress Mail option, we recommend thoroughly testing to ensure it works as expected with your specific setup.
